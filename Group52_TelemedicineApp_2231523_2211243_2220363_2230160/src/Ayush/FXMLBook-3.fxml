Although severalwere occasioned by invitations to contribute to journals and edited volumes, theissues I address are wide-ranging and consistently engaged with current trends anddebates in translation studies as well as in literary and cultural studies. These issuesinclude basic concepts like equivalence, retranslation, and reader reception, sociological topics like the impact of translations in academic institutions and in the globalcultural economy, and philosophical problems like the translator’s unconscious andtranslation ethics. Some essays propose guidelines for how to read and teach translationsas translations, as texts in their own right, relatively autonomous from the source textsthey translate. Others comment on trends in translation research, in translator training, and in publishing. Still others develop historical perspectives which extend fromantiquity to the present. Every essay provides detailed case studies that seek to establish connections between theoretical concepts and their material realization, so thatthe discussions all have a bearing on practice, whether writing, publishing, reviewing,teaching, or studying translations. A number are devoted to considerations of myown translation projects. The genres and text types are varied, both humanistic andpragmatic. They include poems, novels, drama, philosophy, sociology, travel guidebooks, and advertisements. The translating language is English, for the most part, butthe cases also involve such other languages as Catalan, Chinese, Dutch, French,German, ancient Greek, Italian, Latin, Russian, and Spanish.Despite the appearance of randomness, the essays do not constitute a typical miscellany. Taking roughly the past decade as the time frame, the selection I present isintended to serve a dual purpose: to sketch the trajectory of my thinking abouttranslation and to intervene into the main trends in translation research and commentary. These two aims are interrelated in the sense that they have exercised areciprocal influence upon one another, but each is sufficiently distinct that it can bedescribed separately. Insofar as they establish the overall coherence of this book, I willoffer an account of them that also glances at future directions for my own work andfor translation studies.Abandoning instrumentalismThe essays reflect a significant change in my thinking. By the end of the 1990s, I hadformulated an approach to translation that tried to synthesize divergent theoreticalconcepts. The core of the approach was Friedrich Schleiermacher’s notion of atranslation method that signals the linguistic and cultural differences of the sourcetext, subsequently revised in Antoine Berman’s notion of a translation ethics thatrespects cultural otherness by manifesting the foreignness of the source text in thetranslation (see Schleiermacher 1813 and Berman 1999, originally published in 1985).In my view, however, this respect was most effectively shown in an indirect way byquestioning and upsetting the hierarchy of linguistic and cultural values in thereceiving situation, where dominant values tend to suppress differences throughassimilation or to marginalize them through neglect. I located two strategies of“foreignizing” (defamiliarizing and interrogating) these values: a selection of sourcetexts that runs counter to the canon of the source literature already translated and atranslation method that does not necessarily adhere closely to the source text, as bothSchleiermacher and Berman had advocated, but rather cultivates an experimentalismas practiced by the nineteenth-century Italian writer I. U. Tarchetti and the modernistpoet Ezra Pound (Venuti 2008: 15–16, 18–20, 125–26, 176–78).These strategies were based on my understanding that, as the twentieth centuryunfolded, translators worldwide came to work under a discursive regime that values anarrowly defined fluency secured by relying on the most familiar form of the translating language, usually the current standard dialect. Hence innovative variations onthe standard or the appropriate use of nonstandard items can release a foreignizing“remainder” (borrowing Jean-Jacques Lecercle’s concept), effects that exceed asemantic correspondence according to dictionary definitions and register linguisticand cultural differences in the receiving situation (Lecercle 1990; Venuti 1998:10–11; see also below: 37–38). My idea was not so much to abandon fluent translating as to widen its boundaries beyond the restricted lexicon and syntax allowed totranslators. When the discursive regime involves a major language like English orFrench, “major” in terms of its cultural authority or prestige in the global hierarchy oflanguages, an experimental translation strategy can produce a minoritizing effect,“minoritizing” in Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s sense of “deterritorializing” themajor language and culture, taking it on an “escape” that challenges its authority (seeDeleuze and Guattari 1987: chapter 4; Venuti 1998: 9–13). As applied to translation,the concept of minoritizing situates foreignizing practices in national and transnationalframeworks.I have no intention of abandoning the pursuit of foreignizing effects, whether intranslation research or in my translation projects. The idea of mobilizing such effectsto question dominant values in the receiving situation remains a pressing concern –or, more precisely, it has become for me the very definition of humanistic translation2 Introductioninsofar as it traffics in linguistic and cultural differences and should not work todiminish them so as to sustain a status quo, regardless of whether the translating language and culture are central or peripheral, major or minor. No language can affordthe stagnation that results from restricting or excluding contacts with other languages.No culture can afford the complacency of allowing the hierarchy of values thatstructure it to go unexamined and uncriticized (Venuti 2008: 19–20).Nonetheless, I came to recognize that the Schleiermacher–Berman line of thinking, although apparently hermeneutic in its approach, although apparently treatingtranslation as an interpretation, rests uneasily on an instrumental model of translation.Here translation is seen as the reproduction or transfer of an invariant contained in orcaused by the source text, whether its form, its meaning, or its effect. For Schleiermacher and Berman, the foreignness of the source text is an invariant that inheres inits lexicon and syntax, style and genre, theme and discourse, and it is this foreignnessthat the translator must reproduce or manifest by adhering closely to those textualfeatures. Thus Schleiermacher describes what he calls “the true goal of all translation”as “the fullest possible unadulterated enjoyment of foreign works” and as “the mostdirect enjoyment of the works themselves,” where “unadulterated” and “direct”indicate that the translator provides not an interpretation of the source text but ratherunmediated access to that text (Schleiermacher 1813: 61). Berman similarly arguesthat a translation ought “to disclose [d’ouvrir] the Foreign as Foreign in its own linguistic space,” whereby he draws on Martin Heidegger’s concept of truth as thedisclosure of “being” (Berman 1999: 75, where the phrase is italicized; see below:186–87). The assumption of the instrumental model in Schleiermacher and Bermansets up an unexpected resemblance to the rather different thinking of theoristslike Jerome and Eugene Nida, whose respective notions of “sense-for-sense” translation and “equivalent effect” continue to be widely influential (see Venuti 2012a:483–85).Such formulations posit an unchanging essence inherent in or produced by thesource text and freely accessible to the translator, regardless of the time and place inwhich the translating occurs. Instrumentalism does not take into account the transformative difference that translation inscribes in the source text, the ratio of loss andgain that can be glimpsed only indirectly, in the terms of the translating language andculture (hence my recourse to a literary discourse like modernist experimentalism tomake the translator’s work visible). Any sense of foreignness communicated in atranslation is never available in some direct or unmediated form; it is a constructionthat is always mediated by intelligibilities and interests in the receiving situation.The linguistic and cultural differences that make up a source text are inevitablydiminished and altered, even when the translator maintains a fairly strict semanticcorrespondence, because that text is much more than any such correspondence: itsdistinctive linguistic features are the support of meanings, values, and functionsspecific to its originary culture, and these features do not survive intact, withoutvariation, the move to a different language and culture. Instrumentalism is, in aword, a falsehood that cannot offer an incisive and comprehensive understanding oftranslation.Introduction 3I began to develop a more rigorously conceived hermeneutic model that viewstranslation as an interpretive act, as the inscription of one interpretive possibilityamong others. This model assumes that the source text, regardless of whether itsgenre or text type is humanistic, pragmatic, or technical, is radically variable in form,meaning, and effect. The extent of variation is always controlled by the materials usedto interpret the source text and by the institutions where the translation is carried out.In the case of technical texts in law and science (e.g. contracts and patents, medicalresearch and pharmaceutical treatises), it is only the routine application of idiomaticusage, standardized terminologies, and precisely defined functions that serves to limitor preempt variation by fixing the form and meaning of the source text. I subsequently redefined the remainder as the creation of a new context: a translationrecontextualizes the source text in the translating language and culture by applying aset of formal and thematic interpretants to inscribe an interpretation. FollowingJacques Derrida’s concept of inscription, I saw the source text not only as coming tothe translation process as always already interpreted, traced with a cultural discourse,but also as undergoing a further, perhaps divergent inscription when translated;following Charles Peirce’s concept of interpretant, I saw the translation process as theapplication of formal and thematic mediators that perform the inscription, turningthe source into the translated text (Venuti 2012a: 495–99). The inscription and theinterpretant became the key factors in a hermeneutic model that eschews the Germantradition of hermeneutics – notably the work of Heidegger and Hans-GeorgGadamer – where the aim is to disclose an essentialist meaning in the source text.The different model I began to imagine opens up the interpretive possibilitiesof translation, allowing them to vary with the nature of the interpretants applied bythe translator but enabling the interpretations to be described and evaluated withclarity and precision in the conditions – linguistic and cultural, social and political –under which the translation is produced and circulated. The concepts of inscriptionand interpretant increase the explanatory power of the remainder by refining it,facilitating an exact account of the different effects that a translation releases inthe receiving situation – an account that of course is itself an interpretation groundedon a reconstruction of the values, beliefs, and representations that define thatsituation.Treating translation as an interpretive act in this more flexible approach led me toan ethical reflection that acknowledges the inevitable loss of source-cultural differenceas well as the exorbitant gain of translating-cultural difference, a trade-off that exposesthe creative possibilities of translation. To reformulate a translation ethics, I turned toAlain Badiou’s notion of the “event,” the emergence of an innovative form or practice that breaks with cultural and social institutions by pointing to a lack in them(Badiou 2001: 67; see below: 184–85). The translation that sets going an eventintroduces a linguistic and cultural difference in the institution, initiating new ways ofthinking inspired by an interpretation of the source text. As a linguistic and culturalpractice, furthermore, translation is unique in initiating events on an internationalscale, potentially affecting not only the hierarchy of values, beliefs, and representations in the receiving situation, but also the global hierarchy of symbolic capital that4 Introductiontheorists like Pascale Casanova (following Pierre Bourdieu’s sociology) see asstructuring relations between national literary traditions (Casanova 2004).Recovering history, textuality, and agencyOver the past two decades, translation studies has undergone a phenomenal growth asan academic field. Linguistics-oriented approaches remain prevalent in the training oftranslators, where their formidable analytical tools are used to devise solutions totranslation problems that arise primarily with pragmatic and technical texts. Corpuslinguistics in particular has proven useful in analyzing translated texts and in buildingdatabases to assist translators. Yet since 2000, as even a cursory survey of journalarticles, edited volumes, and book-length studies makes clear, various forms of literaryand cultural studies have come to dominate translation research around the world. Themost productive approaches in terms of methodology and findings have been socialin orientation.Sociological theories, notably the cluster of concepts formulated by Bourdieu, haveincreasingly been applied in translation studies. This trend appeared first in francophone sites, Quebec and France, where such scholars as Jean-Marc Gouanvic andGisèle Sapiro have researched the important place of translations in the French literary field. The focus here is on large-scale or systemic trends, examining huge corpora of translations, tabulating publishing statistics, and considering the assimilation ofspecific genres into French literary traditions. Gouanvic (1999; 2007) has studied twogenres of United States literature, science fiction and the realistic novel, translatedinto French during the twentieth century. Sapiro has taken up such issues as theextent to which translation patterns promote “linguistic and cultural diversity” and“indicate a tendency toward denationalizing literary production in the world marketof translation” (Sapiro 2010: 313–18).Within literary studies, a second, related trend has coincided with the reformulationof the Goethean concept of “world” literature by such scholars as Casanova andFranco Moretti. Here too the focus is systemic: translation is seen as internationalizingliterary relations, which are structured hierarchically according to an uneven distribution of symbolic capital among languages and literatures. World literature hasalso been treated as the production of a distinctive form of textuality (foreign formjoined to local content) and as a mode of reception (an accrual of meanings as textscross linguistic and cultural borders). Translation figures prominently in both practices. Theorists of world literature have tended to avoid the close reading of texts forwhat Moretti calls “distant” reading, paying attention either to the transmission ofmicro features like tropes and themes or to the development of macro structures likegenres and traditions (Moretti 2000: 56–58).A third research trend is frankly political, advocating translation practices that areactivist, intervening in social and military conflicts and advocating a particular side.Mona Baker’s effort to isolate ideologically charged narratives embedded in translations, working from a concept of narrative formulated by social and communicationtheorists, has given a strong impulse to this line of inquiry (Baker 2006). TheIntroduction 5difficulty that the translator faces in maintaining neutrality in conflictual situations hasbeen illuminated by Moira Inghilleri’s theoretically nuanced exploration of the ethicaland political stakes involved in interpreting in asylum adjudication and in war zones(Inghilleri 2011). Using a similarly sophisticated approach, Vicente Rafael has tracedthe repressive history by which a uniform American English was enforced in order tounderstand the compromised position of Iraqi interpreters during the United Statesmilitary occupation (Rafael 2009).The social orientation of these trends has made a significant contribution to translation research, not only advancing the field but also attracting the attention ofscholars outside of it. Nonetheless, their commanding influence has meant that certain areas have been studied much less, in some cases neglected entirely. Thisunevenness is all the more conspicuous because translation is a linguistic as well as acultural practice that has given rise to long traditions of theory and commentaryaround the world. The areas that have received less scholarly attention includehistory, textuality, and agency.The past decade has witnessed relatively few projects in which translations havebeen studied in specific cultural situations at specific historical moments, contextualized with the help of extensive archival research. The prevalence of sociological applications and the concern with activism, driven by continuing conflicts andcataclysmic events, have instilled a presentism in translation studies whereby theemphasis has been placed squarely on recent publishing practices, political tensions,and military struggles. On the whole, the leading research trends have shown littleinterest in translation theories and practices, or in texts generally, produced before thetwentieth or twenty-first centuries. As a result, the use of the past not merely as asource of theoretical concepts and practical strategies but as a means of understandingand criticizing the present has been less and less pursued.The nature of the translated text, so important for practice as for training, and theimplications that translated textuality carries for reading and analyzing translations, soimportant for research and teaching, have not been studied much at all. Close readings of translations are explicitly excluded in some recent theories of world literature.Most importantly, the shift to systemic explanations grounded in sociological concepts has tended to suppress the text as a unit of analysis, sometimes deliberately so(see, for example, the rejection of “interpretative” approaches in Heilbron and Sapiro2007: 93–95). The emphasis on narrative in the ideological critique of translations hasnot so much remedied the neglect of translated textuality as drastically limited thepossible interpretants that might be applied both in translating and in analyzingtranslations. If “narrative theory,” as Baker states, “allows us to piece together andanalyze a narrative that is not fully traceable to any specific stretch of text but has tobe constructed from a range of sources,” that theory demands an aggressiveinterpretation of translated texts which excludes other theoretical and critical discourses (Baker 2006: 4). We still do not understand the cultural and social implications of the translator’s verbal choices, and no consensus has developed as tohow translations might be written and read or even what sort of communicative acttranslation is.6 IntroductionWithout a historical sense of the translated text, produced and received in aparticular culture at a particular period, our understanding of the translator’s agencyhas been impoverished. The study of broad developments through notions of thecultural and social field and various forms of capital has considerably illuminatedtranslation patterns, showing how intercultural relations are structured hierarchically,whether between individual linguistic communities or on a global scale. Yet thatapproach has occluded the role played by the translator’s specific verbal choices infavor of treating networks of agents in institutions as most important in the circulationof translations.In this respect, the repeated invocation of Bourdieu’s concept of habitus, anembodied “system of cognitive and motivating structures” that generate practices in afield, has not brought a finer discrimination to the translator’s actions (Bourdieu1990: 52). On the contrary, the application of the concept in translation studies hasbeen extremely reductive, perhaps because the concept itself oversimplifies humanbehavior. Thus Gouanvic asserts thatTranslation as a practice has little to do with conforming to norms through thedeliberate use of specific strategies; in other words, it is not a question of consciously choosing from a panoply of available solutions. Norms do not explainthe more or less subjective and random choices made by translators who arefree to translate or not to translate, to follow or not to follow the originalclosely. If a translator imposes a rhythm upon the text, a lexicon or a syntaxthat does not originate in the source text and thus substitutes his or her voicefor that of the author, this is essentially not a conscious strategic choice but aneffect of his or her specific habitus, as acquired in the target literary field.(Gouanvic 2005: 157–58)Gouanvic is right to distinguish translation norms from conscious deliberation: normsare more likely to be dominant linguistic and cultural values that the translator learnsand applies in a manner that is preconscious or unconscious, and therefore they maybe assimilated to the Bourdieusian habitus (see below: 54). Yet to assume that thetranslator’s verbal choices or strategies all lack deliberation or intentionality, as thereliance on the habitus implies (“The habitus is a spontaneity without consciousness orwill” [Bourdieu 1990: 56]), betrays an utter lack of familiarity with the act of translation, with the myriad choices made during the composition of any literary translation. Gouanvic has in effect collapsed the translator into the literary field, althoughnot without contradiction. The translator may indeed choose to impose a rhythm,lexicon, or syntax, but because such linguistic and literary forms are likely to beselected from the resources available in a literary field, they can be considered transindividual elements which can hardly be identified with an individual voice. In theend, the recourse to the habitus strips the translator’s agency of the full complexity ofhuman behavior, which encompasses not only intended actions but also a selfreflexive monitoring in relation to rules and resources (e.g. translation norms), notonly a degree of consciousness but also an unconscious composed of unacknowledgedIntroduction 7conditions and unanticipated consequences (cf. Giddens 1979: chapter 2; seechapters 2 and 5).Essaying a new approachThe fourteen essays that follow try to profit from concurrent research trends buttacitly take them in more productive directions by compensating for their limitationsas I have defined them. Using a reconceived hermeneutic model as their base, theessays maintain the social and political orientation in translation studies, a feature ofmy work from the very beginning, while theorizing the translator’s agency and thetranslated text in case studies that reconstruct the contexts of production and reception. My assumption has been that translation studies must work to link the social andthe textual so as to advance, but that this link must be rooted in the concept oftranslation as an interpretive act.The essays should not be read, however, as building a coherent argument in asequence of chapters. They are rather essays in the strong sense of the word, discreteattempts to develop a recurrent set of theoretical concepts and to consider theirpractical implications. Hence each essay stages a different argument through theexamination of various cases, and key concepts are formulated more than once,restated with differences that suit the changing contexts. Although the arrangement ischronological (the date of first publication appears within square brackets at the endof each text), the essays can be read individually, apart from any chronology. But ifthe reader chooses to proceed in chronological order, an intellectual trajectoryemerges: a movement away from instrumentalism towards a hermeneutic model oftranslation, an abandonment of the remainder and an adoption of the inscription andthe interpretant, and a rethinking of the ethics of respect which argues that the mostdecisive way for a translation to show respect is to make the source text the groundof an ethics of innovation in the translating culture.Throughout, I have lost no opportunity to worry the questionable distinctionbetween translation theory and practice, whether that practice is research or translating. In “The Name and Nature of Translation Studies” (1972), an essay that has beenviewed as instituting the field but has come to be criticized as limited, James Holmesunfortunately divides research into three categories, “descriptive,” “theoretical,” and“applied” (Holmes 1988: 71, 77; see Chesterman 2009). He finally acknowledges thatthese “branches” are not as “distinct” as he makes them seem because the relations betweenthem are “dialectical” or mutually determining (Holmes 1988: 78). He explains:Translation theory, for instance, cannot do without the solid, specific datayielded by research in descriptive and applied translation studies, while on theother hand one cannot even begin to work in one of the other fields withouthaving at least an intuitive theoretical hypothesis as one’s starting point. (Ibid.)Here Holmes makes the empiricist assumption that knowledge is merely given toobservation rather than constructed on the basis of theoretical concepts. Thus8 Introductiondescriptive and applied research are said to supply “solid, specific data” from whichtheories are inferred: Holmes’s model is scientific, deploying the inductive method.Not only is theoretical speculation reduced to a “hypothesis,” but Holmes also seemsnot to have recognized that a conceptual basis is necessary even to determine whichtextual features, translation strategies, and pedagogical practices can be classified asdata. In treating translation theory as derived from empirical fact, he shows noawareness that the same data can be processed with – and in support of – differingtheories. Nor could he have anticipated subsequent developments in translation studies:over the past half-century, most of the theoretical discourses that have informedresearch have come from outside the field, mainly from such disciplines as linguistics,philosophy, and literary and cultural studies.A similar sort of empiricism can be perceived in translators’ comments about theirwork, where it devolves into an antipathy towards theory. A recent interview withJonathan Galassi is especially pertinent since his work straddles so many culturalpractices: he is a poet, a translator of Italian poetry, and the president and publisher ofperhaps the most distinguished literary press in the United States, Farrar, Straus andGiroux. To the question “Are there particular types of translations or ways of thinking about translation that you’re not interested in or find antithetical to yourapproach?” Galassi responded:I’m afraid I’m not very interested in the theoretical aspects of translation.I think that it’s really a hands-on artistic practice – of course there’s the businessof translation, the economic business of it, but that doesn’t really enter intowhat we’re talking about. We’re talking about vocational work here – the extensionof the poet’s work via an engagement with another writer in another language.And it’s a really interesting question you’re asking me. I think Mark Strand is avery wonderful translator. He has some of the same ability that [Elizabeth]Bishop has. His style is so cool that again, it’s like looking through water.(Fitzgerald 2012)Despite Galassi’s demurral about translation theory, his response rests on certainassumptions about poetry translation, and I would call these assumptions a definitetheory. He values not only the work of poets whose poetry informs the style of theirtranslations, but a particular poetics that he finds in Strand and Bishop. Just before thisresponse, Galassi had praised Bishop’s translations of Brazilian poetry: “I would saythat the limpidity of her own writing comes through in her translations really verybeautifully. It’s like seeing something through very clear water” (ibid.). This image oftransparency points to Ezra Pound’s modernist poetics, which he developed partlythrough his translations. In his essay “Cavalcanti” (1928), Pound indicates the linguistic features that attracted him to the work of the thirteenth-century Italian poetGuido Cavalcanti:We have lost the radiant world where one thought cuts through another withclean edge, a world of moving energies “mezzo oscuro rade,” “risplende in sé" wrapText="true" />
