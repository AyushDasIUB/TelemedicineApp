Found in translation: How language shapesour lives and transforms the world. New York: Penguin. xvi + 270pp. US$16 This book is a great addition to your Christmas list. Nataly Kelly and Jost Zetzsche have 40+ years of experience as translators and interpreters around the world, and they have written a wonderful read entitled Found in Translation (FiT). After a thoughtful forward by linguist David Crystal, it includes a brief introduction, seven delightful chapters, a final note, some acknowledgements, endnotes for the academics reading this, a short list of Internet resources, plus an index.Dedicated to translators and interpreters, the authors distinguish between these groups right away, noting the former deal “with written words” while the latter normally address “the spoken kind” (p. xiv). On the first page, they suggest we should all care about language issues and translation in particular, because it “affects every aspect of your life” (p. xiii). That may sound like a boast, but you’ll likely agree with them by the time you finish learning about their research.Chapter 1 is about translation and interpretation that saves lives in hospitals and other contexts, such as the U.N., including human rights. Chapter 2 turns to issues of war and peace, while Chapter 3 addresses business and the role of translation in crossing borders and building bridges. Chapter 4 is on literary and religious translation, and will be of note for those interested in Bible translation. Chapter 5 reports on some seamier issues in business and life aimed at “delighting the senses”, while Chapter 6 introduces the realities of translation in the entertainment and sports worlds. The final Chapter, 7, reports on the role of translation in technology, including the Internet and social media. While geared toward a North American market, the book is truly international, reporting on all manner of languages and contexts, from Las Vegas to Florida, Canada and Haiti, Iceland and Italy, China and Egypt, Finland, Nigeria, New Zealand, etc. Though many examples relate to translations into or out of English, reading this book is a joy for those who love orthographies, with Arabic, Chinese, Inuktitut, Russian, and Sanskrit being several of the many included.The strengths of FiT are many, including that it is based on years of experience not only of the authors, but also of the various translators and interpreters around the world that they interviewed for this book. Some of the most interesting examples and touching stories recount mistranslations in diverse situations, and distinguish between professional and amateur work in the field. If you like false friends, language borrowing, cultural faux pas, and language revitalization, you will enjoy this book. I appreciate the way the authors spend several pages on a topic, but often intersperse their work with highlighted boxes where they share brief anecdotes on the realities of translation, both oral and written. I smiled and laughed as I read different chapters, but also connected with experiences our translator guides recount dealing with languages and cultures with which I have some familiarity, including situations in Canada, China, Japan, and the U.S.While much here was familiar to me, I learned about Title VI of the Civil Rights Act in the United States, and how it’s beinginterpreted to prohibit discrimination, including that based on language. The authors additionally offer lots of information,and I will be much better prepared to respond to those who suggest, “This is America. Speak English” next time I hear those statements (p. 16). The discussion of “America’s language problem”, recounting the lack of linguistic preparedness in areas of defense and foreign language education, was sobering but helped me appreciate my graduate students who learn and study so many of the world’s languages and cultures, or teach English to many bridge builders. As an applied linguist, this book was an easy read, as it is not an academic but a popular text. Yet people like me who appreciate Internet resources and academic references will also find those amidst the many endnotes for each chapter (16 pages!).For language lovers, FiT is a must read. Although I set out to get an update on translation in reading Found in Translation for pleasure, it has rekindled my love for languages, mostly because it is about so many interesting people who use those languages. As the authors observed at the end of Chapter 1, with languages and translation, “it's not only about them, but about all of us” (p. 32).Michael Lessard-Clouston (aka “Dr. L-C”) studied French/English translation as an undergraduate at York University in Toronto, Canada. Since August 2005 he’s taught applied linguistics and TESOL at Biola, and his most recent research appears in The Linguistics Journal (Vol. 6, 2012) and in an edited collection on Christian Faith and English Language Teaching and Learning (2013).
