Forthese opportunities to speak in lecture series, seminars and conferences, I thankMohammed Abdel Aatty and the organizing committee of the Fifth InternationalSymposium on Comparative Literature at Cairo University, David Bellos (PrincetonUniversity), Peter Bush (British Centre for Literary Translation, University of EastAnglia, and the Institute of Translation and Interpreting), Maria González Davies(Universitat de Vic), Geoffrey Harris (European Studies Research Institute, Universityof Salford), Michael Henry Heim and Katherine King (University of California atLos Angeles), Serena Jin and Chan Sin Wai (The Chinese University of Hong Kong),Alberto Alvarez Lugrís and Maria Teresa Caneda (Universidad de Vigo), MillicentMarcus (University of Pennsylvania), Marta Mateo Martínez-Bartolomé(Universidad de Oviedo), Susan Matthias (New York University), Ramon Ribé(Universidad de Barcelona), and Nicholas Round (University of Sheffield).Louisa Semlyen, my editor at Routledge, gave her unflinching encouragementand helpful advice throughout this project (and patiently waited for its delivery).Katharine Jacobson, Jody Ball and, in its early stages, Miranda Filbee were superblyefficient in getting a very complicated book into production. Hannah Hyamcopyedited the print-out with her customary precision and Susan Dunsmoreproofread the galleys with care.The Italian verse in the dedication is drawn from Milo De Angelis’s poem “Unmaestro” in Millimetri (Torino: Einaudi, 1983).I must acknowledge, finally, the forebearance and inspiration of Lindsay Davies,Gemma Leigh Venuti, and Julius David Venuti, who endured my absences duringmany months of work and were most helpful in distracting me from it.L.V.New York CityJuly 1999INTRODUCTIONTranslation studies: an emerging disciplineTHIS READER GATHERS essays, articles, and book chapters that representmany of the main approaches to the study of translation developed during thetwentieth century, focusing particularly on the past thirty years. It was during thisperiod that translation studies emerged as a new academic field, at onceinternational and interdisciplinary. The need for a reader is thus partly institutional,created by the rapid growth of the discipline, especially as evidenced by theproliferation of translator training programs worldwide. Recent surveys indicatemore than 250, offering a variety of certificates and degrees, undergraduate andgraduate, training not only professional translators, but also scholar-teachers oftranslation and of foreign languages and literatures (Caminade and Pym 1995;Harris 1997).This growth has been accompanied by diverse forms of translation researchand commentary, some oriented toward pedagogy, yet most falling within—orcrossing—traditional academic disciplines, such as linguistics, literary criticism,philosophy, and anthropology. The aim of the reader is to bring together asubstantial selection from this varied mass of writing, but in the form of a historicalsurvey that invites sustained examination of key theoretical developments.Of course, edited volumes always work to define a field, a body of knowledge,a textbook market, and so they create as much as satisfy institutional needs,especially in the case of emergent disciplines. In translation studies, the broadspectrum of theories and research methodologies may doom any assessment ofits “current state” to partial representation, superficial synthesis, optimisticcanonization. This Reader is intended to be an introduction to the field recognizable2 INTRODUCTIONto the scholars who work within it. But the intention is also to challenge anydisciplinary complacency, to produce a consolidation that is interrogative, to showwhat translation studies have been and to suggest what they might be.The readings are organized into five chronological sections, divided into thecentury’s decades and the date of publication for each reading appears at the footof its first page. Whether a decade stands on its own or is combined with othersdepends solely on the volume of translation commentary published within it, sheerbibliographical quantity (cf. the bibliographies in Morgan 1959, Steiner 1975,Schulte and Biguenet 1992). The sections are each prefaced by introductoryessays which present a history of main trends in translation studies, establishinga context for concise expositions of the readings and calling attention to the workof influential writers, theorists, and scholars who are not represented by a reading.The section introductions are historical narratives that refer to theoretical andmethodological advances and occasionally offer critical evaluations. Yet the storiesthey tell avoid any evolutionary model of progress, as well as any systematiccritique. I wanted to outline, however rapidly, the history of the present moment intranslation studies. And to some degree this meant asking questions of the pastraised by the latest tendencies in theory and research.The map of translation studies drawn here, its centers and peripheries,admissions and exclusions, reflects the current fragmentation of the field intosubspecialties, some empirically oriented, some hermeneutic and literary, andsome influenced by various forms of linguistics and cultural studies which haveresulted in productive syntheses. The effort to cast a wide net has notencompassed certain areas of translation research, whose volume and degreeof specialization demand separate coverage regardless of their importance totranslation studies (e.g. interpreting and machine translation). And breadth ofcoverage has limited depth of representation for particular theories andapproaches. The section introductions aim, in brief space, to supply someomissions and sketch a historical setting. And the bibliography not only identifiesparenthetical references made throughout the book, but lists additionalpublications by particularly influential authors. It will be clear that I have tried tocover much—for some, no doubt, too much—in an effort to suggest the varietyof translation studies.The image of the field fashioned by this Reader reflects the contemporaryscene all the more closely because it has been produced in consultation withmany leading writers and translators, theorists, and scholars. They commented onvarious versions of the table of contents, responded to questions about particulartranslation traditions and forms of research, suggested specific texts, made listsof names, and criticized my rationale and principles of selection and organization.Any author or text that received a relatively large number of recommendationsearned some sort of representation here. In some cases, my consultantsencouraged me to collect research that fell outside their specialty. And somehelped simply, but most tangibly, by allowing their work to be reprinted withoutcharge.Their names and locations: Kwame Anthony Appiah (US), Rosemary Arrojo(Brazil), Isabelle Berman (France), Susan Bernofsky (US), Annie Brisset(Canada), Peter Bush (UK), Andrew Chesterman (Finland), Dirk Delabastit" textAlignment="JUSTIFY" wrapText="true" />
